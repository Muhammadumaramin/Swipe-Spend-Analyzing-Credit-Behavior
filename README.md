🔍 Overview
This project was part of my internship at Storied Data Inc., where I designed and developed an interactive dashboard to explore customer behavior related to credit cards and personal loans.
The goal was to uncover patterns and provide meaningful insights to support data-driven decisions.

-> Identify trends across demographic segments (e.g., education level, age group, marital status).
-> Explore car ownership impact on income and risk levels.
-> Visualize transaction and credit amount trends over time.
-> Showcase state-wise credit utilization.
